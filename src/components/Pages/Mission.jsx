                    The overall goal of this website is to provide pregnant teens
                     and/or their guardians with the necessary resources for teen 
                     mothers to continue their education. Teenage parents face numerous responsibilities that can hinder their ability to continue their education. Studies show that “Overall, 53 percent of young women who gave birth as teens received a high school diploma, compared with 90 percent of those who did not.” (Lantos and Manlove 2020). These statistics are significant because education plays a vital role in improving the quality of life for both the parents and their child. Education is a social determinant of health and has a strong correlation with economic prosperity. Therefore, ensuring that pregnant teenagers have the opportunity to continue and finish their education is essential in their success.

                    Education is not a federal right, so education programs vary by state and local level. This website will focus on Texas and New York, but the website identifies rights for all pregnant individuals at the federal level.

                    Having a high school degree improves the weekly take home salary, and having a higher level degree further improve weekly earnings as seen above. While working towards a degree might seem daunting, the long-term benefits are substantial. For teenage parent, this can be challenging since they have to take care of a child, which is a job by itself. Moreover, having children comes with extra expenses like clothes, formula, child care and food. As a result, many parents drop out and decide to join the workforce to provide for their new family. Additionally, it can be extremely challenging to juggle taking care of a child, having a job, and going to school. However, there are programs that assist teens continue their education through affordable child care and extra resources.
