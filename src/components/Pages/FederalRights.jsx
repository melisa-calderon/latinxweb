                You cannot be forced to transfer to an

                    You have the right to take time off from

                <li>
                    If a school does not have a leave policy for students, or the student does not 
                    qualify for leave under the policy, a school must provide a leave for the student as medically recommended.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have the right to decide on your own
